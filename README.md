# snaketut

Snake recreated in Java using Swing that displays the terminal version of the game.

Uses JPanels to create a UI. This implementation uses JTextArea to show what a terminal would display.
Single Player and 2 Players. In 2 Player mode, the goal is to make the other player run into your body.
A "hard mode" exists where you start with a longer snake. 
The "A" represents an apple that increases the body of the snake that collects it.
Currently, your snake loops back around when going through the wall. Might consider making it to where you die if you crash into a wall.
